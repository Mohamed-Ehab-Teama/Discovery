# Exercise 1: Calculate the multiplication and sum of two numbers
# Given two integer numbers, write a Python code to return their product only if the product is equal to or lower than 1000. Otherwise, return their sum.

# number1 = 20
# number2 = 30
# Expected Output: 600

# number1 = 40
# number2 = 30
# Expected Output: 70

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Exercise 2: Print the Sum of a Current Number and a Previous number
# Write a Python code to iterate the first 10 numbers, and in each iteration, print the sum of the current and previous number.

# for i in range(1, 11):
#     print( i + (i-1) )

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Exercise 3: Print characters present at an even index number
# Write a Python code to accept a string from the user and display characters present at an even index number.
# For example, str = "PYnative". so your code should display ‘P’, ‘n’, ‘t’, ‘v’.



# -----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Exercise 4: Remove first n characters from a string
# Write a Python code to remove characters from a string from 0 to n and return a new string.

# For Example:
# remove_chars("PYnative", 4) so output must be tive. Here, you need to remove the first four characters from a string.
# remove_chars("PYnative", 2) so output must be native. Here, you need to remove the first two characters from a string.
# Note: n must be less than the length of the string.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Exercise 5: Check if the first and last numbers of a list are the same
# Write a code to return True if the list’s first and last numbers are the same. If the numbers are different, return False.

# For Example:
# Given list: [10, 20, 30, 40, 10]
# result is True
# numbers_y = [75, 65, 35, 75, 30]
# result is False


# -----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Exercise 6: Display numbers divisible by 5
# Write a Python code to display numbers from a list divisible by 5

# Expected Output:
# Given list is  [10, 20, 33, 46, 55]
# Divisible by 5
# 10
# 20
# 55

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Exercise 7: Find the number of occurrences of a substring in a string
# Write a Python code to find how often the substring “Emma” appears in the given string.

# Given:
# str_x = "Emma is good developer. Emma is a writer"
# Expected Output:
# Emma appeared 2 times

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Exercise 8: Print the following pattern
# 1 
# 2 2 
# 3 3 3 
# 4 4 4 4 
# 5 5 5 5 5

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Exercise 9: Check Palindrome Number
# Write a Python code to check if the given number is palindrome. A palindrome number is a number that is the same after reverse. For example, 545 is the palindrome number.

# Expected Output:
# original number 121
# Yes. given number is palindrome number
# original number 125
# No. given number is not palindrome number

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Exercise 10: Merge two lists using the following condition
# Given two lists of numbers, write a Python code to create a new list such that the latest list should contain odd numbers from the first list and even numbers from the second list.

# Given:
# list1 = [10, 20, 25, 30, 35]
# list2 = [40, 45, 60, 75, 90]
# Expected Output:
# result list: [25, 35, 40, 60, 90]

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Exercise 11: Get each digit from a number in the reverse order.
# For example, If the given integer number is 7536, the output shall be “6 3 5 7“, with a space separating the digits.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Exercise 12: Calculate income tax
# Calculate income tax for the given income by adhering to the rules below

# Taxable Income	        Rate (in %)
# First $10,000	            0
# Next $10,000	            10
# The remaining	            20

# Expected Output:
# For example, suppose the income is 45000, and the income tax payable is
# 10000*0% + 10000*10%  + 25000*20% = $6000.

# Exercise 13: Print multiplication table from 1 to 10

# Expected Output:
# 1  2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 		
# 2  4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 		
# 3  6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27 30 		
# 4  8 12 16 20 24 28 32 36 40 		
# 5  10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 		
# 6  12 18 24 30 36 42 48 54 60 		
# 7  14 21 28 35 42 49 56 63 70 		
# 8  16 24 32 40 48 56 64 72 80 		
# 9  18 27 36 45 54 63 72 81 90 		
# 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100

# Exercise 15: Get an int value of base raises to the power of exponent
# Write a function called exponent(base, exp) that returns an int value of base raises to the power of exp.

# Note here exp is a non-negative integer, and the base is an integer.

# Expected output

# Case 1:
# base = 2
# exponent = 5
# 2 raises to the power of 5: 32 i.e. (2 *2 * 2 *2 *2 = 32)

# Case 2:
# base = 5
# exponent = 4
# 5 raises to the power of 4 is: 625 
# i.e. (5 *5 * 5 *5 = 625)
