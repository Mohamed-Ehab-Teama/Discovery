# Training Plan for GRC Python Problem-Solving (Senior Category)

    # Phase 1: Understanding the Competition Rules & Environment

        # Explain Competition Rules:
        # No internet access allowed.
        # Built-in functions are permitted.
        # Code will be manually reviewed by judges.
        # 3 rounds, each lasting 45 minutes.

# -------------------- # -------------------------- # --------------------

# Phase 2: Core Problem-Solving Training

    # 1. Algorithm Design & Implementation

        # Sorting Algorithms: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort.
        # Searching Algorithms: Linear Search, Binary Search.
        # Recursion & Iteration: Fibonacci sequence, Factorial, Tower of Hanoi.

    # 2. Mathematical & Logical Problems

        # Prime number detection.
        # Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) & Least Common Multiple (LCM).
        # Factorization and modulus operations.
        # Number sequence problems.

    # 3. String Manipulation & Analysis

        # Finding palindromes.
        # Reversing strings.
        # Extracting the longest word from a sentence.
        # Character frequency analysis.

    # 4. Data Structures & Efficiency

        # Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, Sets.
        # Built-in functions for efficient data manipulation.
        # Loop optimization.

    # 5. Game & Simulation-Based Problems

        # Guess the Number Game (randomization, loops, conditions).
        # Rock, Paper, Scissors (AI-based decision-making).
