# Mission1: Multiplication Table Generator 
    # You are a programmer and want to create a program that generates a multiplication 
    # table for a given number. The program should ask the user for a number, and then it 
    # should generate and display the multiplication table for that number from 1 to 10.
    
    
# Mission 2: Calculating Grade Average 
    # You are a teacher, and you need to calculate the average grades of your students. You 
    # have a list of student names and their respective grades. Your task is to write a Python 
    # program that calculates and displays the average grade for the class.
    
    
# Mission 3: Guess the Number Game 
    # You are a programmer and wants to create a simple "Guess the Number" game where 
    # the program will generate a random number between 1 and 100, and the player must 
    # guess the number. The program will provide feedback to the player, indicating 
    # whether their guess is too high, too low, or correct. The game will continue until the 
    # player guesses the correct number. 
    
    
# Mission 4: Finding the Longest Word in a Sentence 
    # You are a programmer and tasked with writing a Python program that finds the 
    # longest word in each sentence. The program should take a sentence as input, analyze 
    # the words within the sentence, and output the longest word.


# Mission 5: Create a program that counts how many times each vowel (a, e, i, o, u) appears in a given sentence.
    # Sample Input
        # Hello, how are you?
    # Expected Output
        # a: 1, e: 1, i: 0, o: 2, u: 1
        

# Mission 6: Develop a program that checks if a number is prime. 
    # A prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself.
    # Sample Input
        # 29
    # Expected Output
        # Yes


# Mission 7: 
    # Write a program that finds the most frequently occurring element in an array. 
    # If there is a tie, return the smallest element.
    # Sample Input
        # 3 5 2 3 5 3 7 2 7
    # Expected Output
        # 3
