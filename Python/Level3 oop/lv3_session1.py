'''
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): paradigm in Python where everything is modeled as objects.
        This helps manage larger codebases by grouping data (attributes) and methods (functions) together into units called classes.
            Example: A Car class that holds both data (model, color) and behavior (accelerate, brake).
    {Significance} : It enhances code reusability and modularity
        reusability : use the code again and again
        modularity : breaking down a program into smaller, manageable, and independent modules
        Makes the code more readable and maintainable, especially for complex applications.

{Procedural Programming} : Code is written as a sequence of instructions. It focuses on functions to perform actions
{Object-Oriented Programming} : Focuses on creating objects that contain both data and functions

Classes: Blueprint for creating objects (like a factory template).
Objects: Instances created from a class.
Inheritance: A way to create a new class using properties of an existing class (child inherits from parent).
Polymorphism: Ability of different objects to be accessed through the same interface. 
    Example: Different classes implementing the same method but having different behaviors

How to Create a class, instance an object, then make interactions between objects
