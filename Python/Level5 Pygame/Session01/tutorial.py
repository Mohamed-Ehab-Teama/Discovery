# Python vs Unity
# That depends on the type of game you want to develop. If you are a beginner in game development, you can create a simple 2D game, such as flip-flop, and for that, you should choose Pygame. On the other hand, if you aim to develop advanced games, then you should go for Unity.

# To install Pygame, open the command prompt and give the command as shown below:
