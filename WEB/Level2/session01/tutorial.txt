CSS => 'cascading style sheets' : is a design language that makes a website look more appealing1.
    It determines the visual structure, layout, and aesthetics of a website, while HTML determines textual content1.
    The significance of CSS in web development is that it brings added design flexibility and interactivity.


While HTML is used to define the 'structure' and 'semantics' of your content,
CSS is used to 'style' it and lay it out. 
    For example, you can use CSS to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features.


The history and evolution of CSS can be summarized as follows:
1994: Håkon Wium Lie proposed the idea of CSS.
1996: CSS1 became a W3C Recommendation.
1998: CSS2 was released and work on CSS3 began. 
CSS3 was published as a set of separate documents known as modules123.
Before CSS: Several style sheet languages were proposed, including DSSSL and FOSI4.

Inline Style, Internal Style, External style

Basic Selectors:
    .class              .intro	        Selects all elements with class="intro"
    .class1.class2	    .name1.name2	Selects all elements with both name1 and name2 set within its class attribute
    .class1 .class2	    .name1 .name2	Selects all elements with name2 that is a descendant of an element with name1
    #id	                #firstname      Selects the element with id="firstname"
    *	                *               Selects all elements
    element	            p               Selects all <p> elements
    element.class	    p.intro         Selects all <p> elements with class="intro"
    element,element	    div, p	        Selects all <div> elements and all <p> elements
    element element	    div p	        Selects all <p> elements inside <div> elements


Pseudo Classes:
    A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element.
    Syntax: "selector:pseudo-class"
    Ex) a:link, a:visited, a:hover, a:active


Combinator: 
    is something that explains the relationship between the selectors.

    descendant selector (space) : ( div p )
        Descendant means anywhere nested within it in the DOM tree. Could be a direct child, could be five levels deep, it is still a descendant.

    child selector (>) : ( div > p )
        The child selector selects all elements that are the children of a specified element.

    Adjacent Sibling Selector (+) : ( p + p )
        select any paragraph tag that is directly after another paragraph tag (with nothing in between)”

    The general sibling combinator (~) : ( img ~ p )
        selects elements at the same hierarchy level
            you would be selecting all paragraphs in an article that come after the image


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Color:
    color names : red, green, black

    HEX code : #RRGGBB : #00ff00, #0000ff, #ff0000
    HEX with transparency : #00ff0080, #0000ff50, #ff000020

    RGB : rgb(Red, Green, Blue) : (0 : 255) : rgb(255, 0, 0)
    RGB with transparency : rgb(Red, Green, Blue, alpha) : (0 : 255), alpha = >(0.0 : 1.0) : rgb(255, 0, 0, 0.5)

    HSL : hsl(hue, saturation, lightness) : hsl(120, 100%, 50%)

    HSLA : hsla(hue, saturation, lightness, alpha) : hsla(120, 100%, 50%, 0.3)


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Background:

    background-color: lightblue;
    opacity: 0.3;

    background-image: url("paper.gif");
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position: right top;
    background-size: 75% 50%;
    background-size: cover;
    background-position: center;
    background-attachment: fixed;
        specifies whether the background image should scroll or be fixed


    background: lightblue url("img_tree.gif") no-repeat fixed center;

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Width and height:

    height: 200px;
    width: 500px;

    height: 50%;
    width: 90%;

    max-width: 500px;
    max-height: 150px;
        The max-height property defines the maximum height of an element.
        If the content is smaller than the maximum height, the max-height property has no effect.

    min-width: 100px;
    min-height: 80px;
        If the content is smaller than the minimum height, the minimum height will be applied.
        If the content is larger than the minimum height, the min-height property has no effect.
